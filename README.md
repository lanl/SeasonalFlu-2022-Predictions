# SeasonalFlu-2022-Predictions
Forecasts of influenza hospitalizations for the US by the Los Alamos T-6 and CCS-3 and NAU team

We are using a compartmental model to perform Bayesian analysis on hospitalization data available for US states and other jurisdictions. The model consists of difference and/or ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the dynamics of seasonal flu. Our methodology, applied to COVID-19 disease transmission dynamics, was published recently (Lin et al., 2021).
