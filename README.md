# SeasonalFlu-2022-Predictions
Forecasts of influenza hospitalizations for the US by the Los Alamos T-6 and CCS-3 and NAU team

We are using a compartmental model to perform Bayesian analysis on hospitalization data available for each state. The model consists of difference and/or ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of seasonal flu. Our methodology, applied to the COVID-19 disease, was published at doi: 10.3201/eid2703.203364.
